KMeans Clustering

## Task 3: Clustering Wheat Seeds with KMeans
This task involves clustering different types of wheat seeds based on their physical characteristics. The goal is to group the seeds into clusters and analyze their properties using visualization techniques and evaluation metrics like inertia and homogeneity.

## Workflow Overview
### Data Preparation
1. Load the dataset, seeds_dataset.txt, containing physical characteristics of seeds.
2. Assign appropriate column names:
area, perimeter, compactness, length_kernel, width_kernel, asymmetry_coefficient, length_kernel_groove, target.
3. Perform initial data exploration using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

### Model Training and Evaluation
1. Apply the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
2. Use the KMeans clustering algorithm to fit the data and evaluate clustering performance with inertia and homogeneity score.

### Visualize clusters to interpret results.
Performance Metrics:
1. Inertia: Measures compactness within clusters.
2. Homogeneity Score: Evaluates the uniformity of clusters compared to true labels (optional for unsupervised learning).

### Requirements
To run this task, you need the following:
1. Python (>=3.7)
2. pandas
3. scikit-learn
4. matplotlib
5. seaborn

### How to Run
1. Load the Dataset:
   Ensure the dataset file path is specified correctly.
   Load and assign column names to the dataset.
   
2. Explore the Data
   Use describe() and visualizations like scatter plots and pair plots for understanding feature relationships.

3. Train the Clustering Model
   Apply KMeans clustering on the dataset.
   Experiment with different numbers of clusters to determine the optimal count using the Elbow Method.

4. Visualize Results
   Use scatter plots and pair plots to visualize the cluster assignments.
   Overlay evaluation metrics like inertia and homogeneity.

### Results
1. Optimal Number of Clusters: Determined using the Elbow Method.
2. Cluster Visualizations: Scatter plots show clear separation between clusters based on features like area and asymmetry_coefficient.
3. Evaluation: Inertia decreases as the number of clusters increases, indicating tighter clusters.
   Homogeneity score highlights the alignment with true labels (optional for supervised insights).
